OS X has a nasty habit of spreading .DS_Store files everywhere, which are an
annoyance on devices which don't hide  them (like my mp3 player). This script
walks through a directory tree and deletes the .DS_Store files it finds.

Usage can be found by running rmds.py -h. Just take care when changing the
directory and filename flags, as recursive deletion can turn nasty. To prevent
major issues rmds will provide a list of files before actually deleting.
